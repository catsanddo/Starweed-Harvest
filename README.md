# Overview

This project was an opportunity to familiarize myself with Godot, and the basics of using a game framework to develop a working program.

This is a simple game where the goal is to collect as many "starweeds" as you can before the timer runs out. To start the game, use the enter button, and then you can control the main character by using the arrow keys. Periodically you will see some sparkles spawn on the screen; if you collect these before they disappear, you will get more time to play!

The main purpose of writing this software was to learn how to use Godot. Once I had the basics of the system down, I was able to focus more on making a game that is both fully complete, and also fun! It was a nice challenge to create a game in 2 weeks that looked polished and also had a solid gameplay loop to it.

Here is a link to a walkthrough of the code and a demo of the game:

# Development Environment

This game was written using Godot, which is an open-source game engine. 

Godot uses a propriety language called GDScript, and this is what I used to write the program. It has a similar syntax to Python.

# Useful Websites

Here are some resources that were helpful as I was making my game:
* [Official Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/)
* [GDScript Reference](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html)

# Future Work

Here are a few things I could add in the future:
* Music for the "game over" screen
* A way to track high scores across computers
* Multiple levels that change things like difficulty and the time limit
